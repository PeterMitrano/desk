# Desk

This project is some Sparkfun Thing Dev code for my electric sit/stand desk. I want to control it from an Alexa device such as an echo.

## Rest API

/up -- make the desk go up at constant speed until it reaches the top.
/down -- make the desk go down at constant speed until it reaches the top.
/stop -- make the desk stop wherever it is.
/height/## -- make the desk go to a given height.
/height/## -- make the desk go to a given height.
/sit -- make desk go to predefined sit position.
/stand -- make desk go to predefined stand position.


## Required hardware

 - two limit switches
 - string potentiometer
 - two 16+" stroke linear actuators
 - two relays
 - power supply to convert wall voltage to 12v DC
